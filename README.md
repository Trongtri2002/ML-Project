# Heart disease predicting project
In this project, we use heart disease dataset to constructing classification machine learning model in R language to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.
The result is described in the slide above which shows that LDA analysis is the best model for predicting cardiovascular disease and chest pain is the most important symptom for illness diagnosis.
